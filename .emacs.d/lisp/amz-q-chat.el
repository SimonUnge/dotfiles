;; Q chats happen in /sessions/, which represent Q chat processes
;; running outside of Emacs.  Each Q chat process has its own context,
;; including access to underlying system resources.
;;
;; Depending on your circumstances, you might prefer different behaviors:
;;
;; - You want a single chat session, not tied to any specfic activity.
;; - You want multiple chat sessions, one per open workspace.
;;
;; We use the "term" library, which expects each interactive terminal
;; session to have a meaningful name.  It creates a buffer based on that
;; name, making the name part of UX navigation; it also tags the
;; underlying Emacs process with the name.

interactive experience, while still conforming to the chat's
command-line editor expectations.

This chat interface supports multi-line input.  Edit the buffer using
your preferred method, and insert linefeed characters to separate
lines.  (Anything that calls `newline' under the hood should work, or
use \\`C-q C-j' to insert the linefeed directly.)  When done, use \\<term-mode-map>\\[term-send-input]
